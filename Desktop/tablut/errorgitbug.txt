GITBUG ERROR REPORT

1. Type of operating system you are using to produce this error:


Mac OSx


2. Version of the Java system you are using (java -version).


Java 8


3. Subdirectory of your Git working directory to use as the current
   directory when compiling and running your program.

repo/proj2


4. EXACT sequence of commands that will cause the error you are seeing,
   including anything needed to compile and execute the program.
   It is NOT acceptable to say "any execution of the program fails"; give
   us a specific one.

from my command line:

    > auto white
    > auto black


5. What you see when you execute the commands in 4.

    When I run the commands above, the AI players play about 10ish move and then start playing the same series of moves over and over again,
    but the game should be ending at that point. I have run all these move commands manually and they say that black wins at a certain point.
    My AI does not recognize black winning. I have tested checkRepeated so I believe it is correct. Here is the output:
